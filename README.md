The Voting Game
=================

The `Voting Game' is as it reads, a game in which a group of voters elect a
winner out of set of candidates. The winner is elected by the plurality rule. To
play the game, all players must learn the rules of the game and how to play it
from almost an identical tutorial provided in both languages English and Hebrew
(local native language).
